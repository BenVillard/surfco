# About 

SurFCo is a Matlab toolbox with some C++ Scripts to compute a surface mesh from biological delineations, contours or segmentations. It has been developped at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBME), at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Professor Vicente Grau, and Dr. Ernesto Zacur. 

This work has been published in the following publications, if you use the code we would highly appreciate you citing them:

# Download and Build

SurFCo uses VTK files. Currently this package only works on windows machines. If you have VTK enabled on MAC, please replace the relevant VTK files (MAC Compiled) inside the "Library/VTK" folder. 

The main file to run is "SurFCo.m". Please refer to [1] for help with parameter selection. Note: SurFCo.m can be run as is. 

An example dataset is provided to ensure SurFCo runs properly. Please run Example_1.m as a test run.
