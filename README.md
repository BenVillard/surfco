# SurFCo: Surface Mesh From Contours

# About 

SurFCo is a Matlab toolbox with some C++ Scripts to compute a surface mesh from biological delineations, contours or segmentations. It has been developped at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBME), at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Professor Vicente Grau, and Dr. Ernesto Zacur. 

This work has been published in the following publications, if you use the code we would highly appreciate you citing them:
